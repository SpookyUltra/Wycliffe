<pre>Righteous to a fault

Challenges Gods test.

Not over pearly gates to vault;

But, in fallen virtue, to quest.


Out of ashes into fire

And into rebirth seen.

Man holds a phoenix ire

Born to sin, neâ€™er between.


This is the eternal struggle told,

Sisyphus rolls on high.

Denied, not he, of spirits old

But of a spiritual sigh.


Go see their sweet passivity,

Sorrow grip your bones

For stagnant mediocrity

Suffice to some alone.


No will to power

Willing less, to fight, but cower

Dispose of ancient rites

And heap them on the pyre

Make them something cheap and trite

For masochist desire.</pre></center>
