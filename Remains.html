<center><pre>Men, good men died and passed away,

Memory gone, in speech not forgotten,

Their whims and ire laid,

Their hopes and dreams are trodden.




A few good men remain, here on mortal ground,

To see their prospects buried lost and torn

Their heroes stabbed, no longer found,

The past fades quick, and flags are quickly worn.




Since then the time of war has passed

And with it glory, honour, loss.

The suffering that once made us strong

Been thrown, but at what cost.




But even in this heathen time, a ghost,

called War, The wind does ever blow,

And those remaining will be host

be thrown into those throws.




Fools and us alike will end up in the dirt

Sentimental as the birds to think that all men live and chirp.

They will return to blood and mud, and till then heaven's barred,

Under Gods sustaining eye, we’re damaged and we’re marred.</pre></center>
