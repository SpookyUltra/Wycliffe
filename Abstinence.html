<center><pre>She, arms crossed o’er swollen belly, at platform no. 5
 Perched up, hawk-eyed, waiting for her fancie to arrive
 On steel carriage pulled by invisible white mares
 Her man pays his dues and counts his fares

 Eyes wander through streaming crowds, billowed steam
 Like a plumed cloak of heavenly cloud enshroud him
 Until that second when they match and gaze is fixed.
 Like some break on the wheel of time it stops
 For a moment. They transparent and gliding,
 Drawn intrepidly toward the other in meeting,
 Moulded, contorted and ear to mouth confiding
 “You hardly knew me and our love was fleeting”
 
 She, Stationary, arms crossed at platform no. 5
 Mouth trembling and shaking for she knew
 Her fancie, she was sure, little chance, survived.</pre></center>
