<pre>Aloft the cave and looking in

Where me and mother sat,

Tying up my hair with a pin

On the doorstep mat, cross hatched

Knuckles rapt on each chin.

Thin, dusty, pleasant and patched

Gnawing at stems and lettuce heads.




We knew what it could not know.

Beneath that coat of white

It’s twisted leg, a lump, low

In the skin, a cancers growth.




We whispered,

Though he couldn’t hear,

Communing such as seers

Among the oaks and mistletoe leaves

On 7th of December, Christmas nears

Snow bull drifts have disappeared.

Dab away those tears

On school knit jumper sleeve.

It’s rough grey wool, mucus soft.




Between mother, me;

Transversal funeral points

My coat layers’ approach

To blossom into soft tarmac,

Red Wellington boots against

Chaos’ puddle splash

A firmer being to things as these

To wear the veil late in grief

Where my mother may rest to sleep.</pre></center>
