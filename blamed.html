<center><pre>Stout he stands above the hearth
 To warm his hands and face.
 Sharp features matching pokers edge
 In this room of (supposed) proven place.
 Men here rakes of grovelled worth
 No right to stand in stead.

But this man recluse above the hearth
 Earnt his weight and belts.
 He took punches cleanly dealt
 And turned around to know
 He did not strike
 That ever damning blow. But
 That in his peace and reservation
 The land he loved was thrown.</pre></center>
