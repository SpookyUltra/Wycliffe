<center><pre>A man should turn to face his mortal ends

The ways in which the spirit swerves and bends

Twisting in around itself, a ghostly coil wrought

Catching fibres of prickled skin like thorns.

Wrenching round the gut, gasped like punctured lung

Bittersweet delight at life which previously was unsung

Evokes itself an elegy for those whose hearts in dread

Do know for all their struggles, they're living and they're dead.</pre></center>
