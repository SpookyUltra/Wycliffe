<pre>Steaming great engine turning the city
 Weighty chains of lettered men a plenty.
 Carousel of faces, the Bond of enmity,
 Adversr'y to ally through adversity.

Dizziness of busied life, irritation beared.
 Go astray a wild way, few have dared
 to cross a path Not too often beat or cared.
 Toward the solemn silence that's seldom shared.

A garden locked between four walls and a gate.
 Early spring putting on blossom of late.
 To ponder those others too of similar trait
 Who long for the solace of a secret place:

Fragile frames that fetter cloths
 In a wardrobe placed, pure luck
 That in this house unfurled
 (Though more like flowers plucked)
 A portal to another world
 In a wooden box of moths.

Or locked behind a hidden door,
 But clasped within a Robins claw,
 The keys to end that winters thaw,
 And heal those wounds by time made raw.

Or in a forest up a tree to meet,
 Those fable fae friends of silky sweet,
 And lands where nothings short to eat.

Or at those thirteen deafening strikes,
 Do wonder out into the night,
 Times fabric thin and quite
 Intertwined with memory in delight.

All in all the worlds we seek
 Removed from times cruel entropy.
 And into lands beyond the mortal peek
 Those of fabricated fantasy
 To find a comfort far from havocs wreak.</pre></center>
