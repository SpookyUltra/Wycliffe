<center><div id="article"><p>The Chancellor’s August statement announced that the Conservative government had delivered over 2.7 million new jobs since 2010. These figures, though true, are tenuous in how genuine they puport to be as a reflection of real term employment. From the pulpits, press office and PMQ’s a placid image of quiet sustainable growth (some would say stagnation) is purveyed.</p>

<p>Persistent doubt over the validity of these figures is leaped upon by labour which hopes to align the direction of this discontent toward zero-hours contracts. A student, Londonish type or stray worker might find this of some relevance, but does little for anyone else.  The case of social malignancy (work conditions, intimidation, slave labour) arising due to these contracts is a dismal one and one costing labour its credulity. Only around a third of people on zero hours want a better deal, less than half a million. They don’t complain about Zero-hours’ terms though either, they want to work more, A high proportion of the contracts are part-time an issue of full employment aside from Zero-hours. Despite Zero-hour complaints the percentage of the labour force in full time employment has stayed the same, suggesting the problem of unwanted low hours are comparative and temporary.</p>

<p>It is another case of ignoring a problem, one the voters recognise, one labour wilfully abandon riding the scapegoat of their buzzword “neoliberalism”. That accusation however, is not far wrong; big business wants cheap labour and that means inflating the size of the pool. A common counter to this is to regard average wage growth, however the quoted statistics appear not to take into account disparities between income brackets. Working and middle class stagnation in the growth of wages should be a major consideration.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate hangs insubstantially around the 5% figure a decrease from last year of 0.5%, low granted, but a plateau.</p>

<p>With an increase in the workforce of 1.2% (or 409,000) we might expect something a little more significant. This growth (as may be expected) is driven by immigration, in fact it makes up more than half the increase in employment. The decrease in economic inactivity has its influence, 116,000 to be exact, a number that accounts for over half of new UK national employment (included in this are non-uk nationals who were economically inactive). A larger percentage of new labour is being occupied by immigration. Whether that means they occupy a previously open job is highly contentious (A significant number of employment comes from skilled or professional industries) but a contagious idea, one that finds its mainstay within anti-immigration rhetoric. Where Con/Lab fail to address the issue, deflating it or otherwise, Ukip will gain ground, furthemore the major issue of the referendum perhaps landing vote leave the victory.</p>

<p>Perhaps the influence of Brexit will alter this political dynamic ousting radicals from the mainstream. With polling for the Conservatives rising this ever increasingly seems to be the case, either due to a fractured opposition or from public expectation for the Conservative government to deliver on free movement.</p>

<p>However, considering how the number of jobs were increased in the previous year, and how OBR forecasts predict a rise in this number year on year, up to 500,000, it should challenge any expectation of reduced immigration. Unless these figures are to be reached using the existing labour pool, something very unlikely, it is therefore increasingly clear that Free movement may not be sacrificed. If Conservatives restrict free movement, the economic decline and business pressure could oust them at the next election, if not then same leave voters could do the same. The government’s path over the next four years is a thin one, and one they’d be advised to tread carefully.</p>

<p id="edit">/04/12/15 Update: As David Davis retreats on hard Brexit it may become clear the gov nor EU will sacrifice free movement.

All figures are taken from the ONS from the beginning of the 2016 between January and March, the figures to be annual, because they consider discrepancies between seasonal trends. all statistics are current and therefore comparable; no nearer contemporary sources are used due to no recent publications of migrations statistics until December 1st.</p></div></center>
