<pre>Based on Steeles description of the coffee
 house in the spectator from the perspective of 
a licentious rake. Coffee houses are based near
inns of the court and attract law students who 
debate. Steele names coffee houses The Grecian, 
Squires and Searles by The Temple, Grays Inn 
and Lincolns Inn respectively, which he uses 
as inspiration for his illustration of coffee 
houses:</pre>

<br>
<pre>The bell sounds at the entrance of Joes
 From The fierce rains upheaval and the stormy blow
 From cold into the light and warmth of the shop:
 Coffee tastes strongly to the sound of the broth,
 Oak made the benches, mismatched shape of chairs,
 Where talking and chatter would erupt from the air.
 Her face across counter, stretches and smiles
 Her eyes avert mine and I wait the while

She passes the drinks and soon I am next
 Look at the board and choose what is best
 “White and two sugars” say cautiously, softly
 Treading round glares of my lady’s roughing.
 Too many times have I tempered that steel?
 My fires and furies have made that she brittle

I arrive at the spot where I thrust out my stake,
 Among the young lads, old geezers and rakes.
 They stop heated speaking and wait till I seat
 Then discussions continue whilst one fills me in.

 From the Politics and scandal to liars and cheats
 To Marlborough, Mayfair and military feats
 I wave my palm, interject to murmuring frowns
 to contemplated glances, to sips and rounds.
One takes a side, opposing the motion
 That the minister’s friend should earn his promotion
 Another agrees and slowly it seems
 That division tween parties at the hiss of steam
 All sides of the house drawn with barricaded sides
 To argue their point, demean and be snide
 Not a pocket or crevice in the shop was to hide.

 Lampooning opponents, no rules to the game
 To defeat through facts or a personal shame.
 Light-hearted fun, meanwhile prodding their way
 Through the ranks of experience, of wit, then to fame.</pre></center>
